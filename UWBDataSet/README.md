# UWB LOS and NLOS Data Set
Data set was created using [SNPN-UWB](http://www.log-a-tec.eu/mtc.html) board with DecaWave [DWM1000](http://www.decawave.com/sites/default/files/resources/dwm1000-datasheet-v1.3.pdf) UWB radio module. Measurements were taken on 7 different indoor locations:
* Office1
* Office2
* Small appartment
* Small workshop
* Kitchen with a living room
* Bedroom
* Boiler room.

For measurements two UWB nodes were used: one node as an anchor and the second node as a tag. Only traces of LOS and NLOS channel measurements were taken without any reference positioning (this data set is not appropriate for localization evaluation).
