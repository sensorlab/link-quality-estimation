# Dataset - Michigan University

**Traceset of RSS measurements of a Mica2 sensor network deployed at the University of Michigan in 2006.**

This is a traceset of RSS measurements collected by Mica2 sensor nodes deployed inside and outside a lab room, with anomaly patterns occurring when students walked into and out of the lab. A web camera recorded the activity that could be matched with detected anomalies. The mission of this experiment was to use the RSS sequences to detect any intruders (anomalies). The ground truth indicator (camera recordings) can be used for evaluating the detection performance.
